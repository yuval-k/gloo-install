Gloo is a function gateway built on top of the [Envoy Proxy](https://www.Envoyproxy.io). Gloo provides a unified entry point
for access to all services and serverless functions, translating from any interface spoken by a client to any interface
spoken by a backend. Gloo aggregates REST APIs and events calls from clients, "glueing" together services in-cluster, 
out of cluster, across clusters, along with any provider of serverless functions.

```
to get started quickly.
